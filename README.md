### **Mobile App Development Exercises**

Hello üëã This is a boilerplate repository to help you prepare your mobile development environment before the interview
date.

Please, review the setup of the repository, install all the necessary dependencies and verify that emulators work
appropriately.

### **Setup**

Throughout the course of the exercises, we will be collaborating on fixing partially working application and also on
adding several new behaviors.

* Choose whichever IDE or Editor (Android Studio, XCode, CLI tools, VSCode, etc.) you are comfortable with.
* Install predefined dependencies in the boilerplate.
* You can modify project structure the way you want, but better to wait on the exercise shared with you.
* Choose and install any libraries or dependencies that you are comfortable with or prefer using. We can also install
  dependencies during the exercise as you receive more information about the features
* We will be using iOS emulator, but if you are more comfortable with Android, no worries it works too.

Good luck üçÄ
